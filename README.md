# Bee

Bee is a collection of utilities I use on my side projects.

Example of utilities:

* Testing
* Error handling
* String formating (although the C++'s std lib has that now)
* Time management (C++ std lib also has this, but I don't like their interface)
* File access (C++ std lib also has this, but I don't like their interface)
* hex encoding
* string hash functions
* etc...
